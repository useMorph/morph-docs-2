You can use React components and JavaScript in MDX files.

## Using React components

You can import and use components from jsx and tsx files created in the project directory.

```jsx

## Using Custom Component

import { Card } from '../components/Card';
<Card 
  title="Sample App + Code" 
  icon="link" 
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-7fyrdn?file=src%2Findex.mdx"
/>
  
```

You can also use React components declared within the MDX file. Use `export` in variable declarations within the MDX file, as described below.

```jsx

## Declaring and Using React Components

export const Card = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.children}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

<Card title="Card Title">
  Card Content
</Card>
```


## Using JavasSript variables

JavaScript variables can be declared and used in MDX files.

**Declare Variables**.

Variables used throughout the page are declared in the MDX file using `export`.

```jsx
export const openTime = new Date();
```

**Referencing Variables**.

Declared variables are referenced by enclosing them in `{}`.

```jsx
export const openTime = new Date();

The time the page was opened is { openTime.toLocaleString() }
```

The result is as follows.

export const openTime = new Date();

The time the page was opened is { openTime.toLocaleString() }


<Warning>The content enclosed in `{}` is evaluated as a JSX node and must be either a string, boolean, number, null, undefined, or React component.</Warning>
