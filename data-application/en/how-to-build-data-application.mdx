## MDX

When building data applications in Morph, use [MDX (https://mdxjs.com/)](https://mdxjs.com/) For more information on how to use MDX, see the [official MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).

The `.mdx` files created under the `src` directory of the workspace serve as individual pages in the data application.

## Sample Applications

We have prepared a sample of an actual data application built using Morph components. You can check the code and behavior of the sample application at the following link.
