## Running the set-up commands

<Warning>Normally, you can skip this step because the workspace system will do it automatically. Try it if you have trouble getting it to start.</Warning>

To build a data application, first open the Morph workspace and execute the following commands. This may take several minutes.

```bash Shell
npm i -S @use-morph/page-build && npx morph-page init
```

Once this command has been executed, you can start building your data application.
