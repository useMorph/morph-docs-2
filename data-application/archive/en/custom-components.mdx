Custom components can be used in MDX files.

## Create a `.tsx` file to define custom components

You can create `.tsx` files on Morph to define custom React components.

The Morph data application uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to build React applications.

Styling using Tailwind CSS is also possible, as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is installed by default.

## Adding dependency packages

You can freely add npm packages to the Morph workspace.

Run the npm install command from the terminal to add packages.
