# Solution

In Morph, an API server is started within the workspace to execute SQL/Python from MDX. This error occurs if the API server has crashed or has not been started for some reason.

Typically, the API server is set to automatically recover if it crashes, but this error may occur if the server fails to start.

To resolve this, run the following command in the terminal to restart the API server and fix the error:

```shell
supervisorctl -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf start morph-vm
```
