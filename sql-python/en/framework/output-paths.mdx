title: 'output_paths'
---

The results of executing SQL and Python source code are temporarily stored in the VM so that they can be used as input for subsequent processing.

The format of the stored results depends on the format of the result of the respective process. The output destination and format can also be changed by specifying the output_paths argument of the SQL config function or Python `@morph.func`.

## Output format

### SQL

By default, it is saved as a `.parquet` file. It is also possible to specify csv in the `output_paths`.

### Python

The format specified in the `@morph.func` argument output_type or, if not specified, automatically deduced from the return value.
The format of the file to be saved depends on the type of the value returned by the function, as follows.

#### DataFrame

By default, it is saved as a `.parquet` file. It is also possible to specify csv in `output_paths`.

### Plotly and Matplotlib charts.

By default, both `.html` and `.png` files are saved. It is also possible to limit the extension to be saved with `output_paths`.

<Tip>
By specifying an output extension, such as `output_paths=[‘_private/sample.png’]`, it can be changed so that only files with the specified extension are output.

For more information on how to code in the case of visualisation, see [documentation here](/sql-python/en/python/quickstart-python).

### JSON

If the return value is a dict or list, it is saved as a `.json` file.

### markdown

If the return value is str and `output_type` is `markdown`, the file is saved as a `.md` file.

### Text

If the return value is str and no `output_type` is specified in particular, it is saved as a `.txt` file.

## How to specify `output_paths`

You can specify output paths by specifying paths in `output_paths` as follows.

```sql
{{
    config(
        name="sample_sql",
        description="Sameple SQL for output_paths",
        output_paths=[
            "_private/{name}/{now()}{ext()}",
            "_private/{name}/{now()}.csv"
        ]
    )
}}

select * from sample;
```

### Placeholders

In output_paths, the following placeholder can be used to allow dynamic specification of output destinations.

|Placeholder|Description|
|---|---|
|`name`|Value of `name` specified in `config`, `@morph.func`|
|`now()`|Output date in the format Y/M/D - H/M/S|
|`unix()`|Time stamp (in milliseconds)|
|`ext()`|Auto-estimated extensions|
