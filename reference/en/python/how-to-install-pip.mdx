title: 'How to install pip packages'

Morph allows you to use pip to install packages when you want to do external modules in Python.

## How to use pip on Morph

1. Identify the name of the package you want to install.

    For example, if you want to use the openai API client, you can pull it up with the package name `openai`.
    This can be identified by asking LLMs such as chatgpt, or you can search for it [here](https://pypi.org/).

2. On the editor, press Control + ` to open the terminal.
3. Execute the following command on the terminal:

    `pip install {package name}`

    `{package name}` must be the one determined in 1.

4. From the code, check that the relevant package is available.

    Once installed, the package will continue to be available in that workspace the next time it is launched. To use it in a different workspace, you need to install it separately.
