The `morph compile` command is used to compile the Morph source code.

It is automatically invoked before commands such as `morph run` are executed, but it is used when you want to perform compilation only when debugging to resolve compilation errors.

## Examples

```shell
workdir $ morph compile
Successfully compiled! ðŸŽ‰
```
