title: 'load_data'
---

The load_data function can be used to treat the results of other cells as if they were tables.

You can access the result file after running the `users` cell as a table if you write.

<Warning>
If load_data is used in the from clause, the SQL syntax must use DuckDB syntax.
</Warning>

```sql
{{
	config(
		name="user_data_with_age_over_20",
		description="User data with age over 20",
	)
}}

select
	*
from
	{{ load_data("users") }}
where
	age > 20
```
