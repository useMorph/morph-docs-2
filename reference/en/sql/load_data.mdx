title: 'load_data'
---
By using the load_data function, you can treat the results of other cells as a table.

If you write as follows, you can access the result file after executing the `users` cell as a table.

<Warning>
When using load_data in the from clause, you need to use the SQL syntax of DuckDB.
</Warning>

```sql
{{
	config(
		name="user_data_with_age_over_20",
		description="User data with age over 20",
	)
}}

select
	*
from
	{{ load_data("users") }}
where
	age > 20
```
