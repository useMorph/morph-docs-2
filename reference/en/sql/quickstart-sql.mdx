title: 'Quickstart - SQL'
---

On Morph, data can be retrieved by writing SQL against the connected database.

On SQL, by utilising the `config` function and specifying a connection, you can easily issue SQL against the database connected with Connections.

```sql
{{
	config(
		name="test",
		description="this is test sql statement",
		connection="your_connection_slug"
	)
}}

select 1 as test
```

<Warning>Although it is common practice in SQL to add a semicolon at the end of a statement, the use of semicolons is prohibited to prevent multiple SQL being written in a single file. </Warning>

## Jinja


SQL files on Morph can be written flexibly with Jinja, which allows conditional branches such as placeholder and if statements to be written in the SQL.

Functions are also available to make data analysis easier by utilising Jinja. See `config` and functions such as `load_data` for more information on this.
