title: 'output_paths'
---
The results of executing SQL and Python source code are saved so that they can be used as input for subsequent processes.

The format of the saved results varies depending on the format of each process's result. Additionally, you can change the output destination and format by specifying the output_paths in the SQL config function or the Python `@morph.func` argument.

## Output Formats

### SQL

By default, results are saved as `.parquet` files. You can also specify csv in `output_paths`.

### Python

The format specified in the output_type argument of `@morph.func` is used, or if not specified, it is automatically inferred from the return value.
The format of the saved file changes depending on the type of value returned by the function, as shown below.

#### DataFrame

By default, results are saved as `.parquet` files. You can also specify csv in `output_paths`.

### Plotly and Matplotlib Charts

By default, both `.html` and `.png` files are saved. You can also limit the file extensions saved by specifying them in `output_paths`.

<Tip>
By specifying the output extension like `output_paths=["_private/sample.png"]`, you can change it to output only files with the specified extension.

### JSON

If the return value is a dict or list, it is saved as a `.json` file.

### markdown

If the return value is a str and `output_type` is `markdown`, it is saved as a `.md` file.

### Text

If the return value is a str and no specific `output_type` is specified, it is saved as a `.txt` file.

## How to Specify `output_paths`

You can specify the path in `output_paths` to designate the output destination path as shown below.

```sql
{{
    config(
        name="sample_sql",
        description="Sameple SQL for output_paths",
        output_paths=[
            "/tmp/morph/{name}/{now()}{ext()}",
            "_private/{name}/{now()}.csv"
        ]
    )
}}

select * from sample;
```

### Placeholders

In `output_paths`, you can use the following placeholders to specify dynamic output destinations.

|placeholder|description|
|---|---|
|`name`|The value of `name` specified in `config` or `@morph.func`|
|`now()`|Outputs the date in the format (%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)|
|`unix()`|Timestamp in milliseconds|
|`ext()`|Automatically inferred extension|
