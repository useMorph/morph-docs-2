Morph is built on a framework that makes it easy to manage source code for analysis, such as SQL and Python, and to utilise the results of executions.

The framework consists of a CLI and a corresponding directory structure.

## CLI

All execution of the source code on Morph is done through the CLI. Each SQL, Python function name is compiled, dependencies are resolved and executed.

The CLI is installed in the workspace VM, so besides operating from the UI, commands can also be executed directly.

```shell
morph run example_sql_cell.sql
```

## Directory structure

In order to compile from the CLI, the directory structure must match the Morph framework. It is also possible to change the default directory by editing the configuration values in `morph_project.yml`.

The important directories are described below.

### canvases

The canvases contain the file `***.canvas.json`. This directory is used for the canvas mechanism for data flow visualisation.

For more information on canvases, see [documentation here](/docs/en/workspace/about-canvas).

### src

`src` is the directory where the source code is located. It contains files such as `.sql`, `.py`, `.mdx` and `.vg.json`.

The source code on this src is compiled and parsed into an executable form by the CLI.

### templates

This directory is used to place user-defined source code that is user-defined as a template.

For more information on templates, see [documentation here](/docs/en/workspace/template).
