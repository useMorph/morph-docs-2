To set up a connection to BigQuery, open the Connections tab on the home screen, open the Connection Settings modal via the Create New Connection button and select BigQuery.

## Authentication method

Two methods are available for connecting to BigQuery: Service Account or OAuth2 authentication. Both methods provide secure access to BigQuery data and can be chosen according to the application.

**OAuth2 Certification**

OAuth2 is a way for third-party applications to securely access Google services without the user directly using their own Google account credentials.

**Service Account Certification**

Service Account is used by applications to access Google Cloud services without user intervention. It is mainly used by back-end systems and automation scripts.

### BigQuery integration using OAuth2 authentication

**Setup procedure:**

1. select ‘OAuth2’ in the Morph settings and use the ‘Sign in with Google’ button to authenticate with your Google account.
2. when you are redirected from Sign in with Google to the Google Cloud Platform side screen, allow the Morph connection request. If you allow it, you will be redirected to the Morph screen and the configuration is complete.

### BigQuery integration with Service Account

**Setup procedure:**

1. create a Service Account in Google Cloud Platform and obtain its JSON key. [Ref: [Creating and managing Service Account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys?hl=ja)]
2. select ‘Service Account’ in the Morph settings and upload the downloaded JSON key to the field you specify.

### Complete the connection settings.

> Once you have completed the Account section and pressed the Create button in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, you can now enter the Connection slug to complete the connection settings.

1. **Connection slug**
    - Uniquely identifies the connection to the external data source and cannot be empty. Use only letters, numbers and underscores as desired.
