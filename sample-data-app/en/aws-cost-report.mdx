In this sample data app, we use the AWS SDK to analyze costs by product code.

You can visualize how costs fluctuate over time for each product used on AWS. Additionally, by implementing a filter function for product codes, you can enable a more drilled-down analysis experience.

## Usage

### Step 1: Create a new workspace from the AWS Cost Report template

In the workspace list, select the "AWS Cost Report" template to create a new workspace.

### Step 2: Create an IAM with the BillingReadOnlyAccess policy in the AWS Console

To use the AWS SDK in this template, please prepare an IAM with the BillingReadOnlyAccess policy for this data app. Save the credentials for this IAM locally in a secure way, as you will use them in the next step.

### Step 3: Set environment variables within the workspace

Download the credentials from the IAM you created and set them in the `.env` file in the workspace.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=PUT_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_KEY=PUT_YOUR_SECRET_KEY
AWS_REGION=PUT_YOUR_AWS_REGION
```

### Step 4: View the results from Pages

Once the environment variables in Step 3 are correctly set, you can access the sample app results from the Pages section.
