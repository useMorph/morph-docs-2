## How to use Canvas

Canvas can be used from the Code tab in the Editor screen of the cloud version.

You can do the following:

### 1. Check the data pipeline

You can visually check the data pipeline created using `load_data` in SQL and Python.
It is easy to check the impact of editing the data aggregation logic or files.

### 2. Data pipeline construction with MorphAI

MorphAI has two features for constructing data pipelines from Canvas.
It allows you to perform data analysis quickly using natural language.
