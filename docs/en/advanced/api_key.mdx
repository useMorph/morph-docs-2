By logging into the cloud and creating an API Key from the home screen, you can do the following:

- Deploy data applications built locally
- Access the built-in PostgreSQL via RestAPI

## Using API Key with CLI

By executing the following command in the CLI, the API Key will be saved in `~/.morph/credentials`.
When accessing the cloud from the CLI, such as with `morph sync`, this setting will be used for access.

```bash Shell
morph config
```
<Tip>You can also configure it by directly editing the contents of `~/.morph/credentials`.</Tip>

## About Source IP

The Source IP that can be specified when creating an API Key restricts the IP addresses that can access the built-in PostgreSQL via RestAPI.

<Warning>It does not function as an IP restriction when using CLI operations such as `morph sync`.</Warning>
