Morph automatically generates and provides APIs based on the created database schema. This allows for data integration and application development using Morph's database through the API without implementing additional code.

The API is designed in a RESTful format and can be securely accessed using an API key created from Morph's dashboard.

### **Features**

Morph's database API is provided by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/) and offers the following benefits:

- **Efficient Development and Integration**:
    - APIs are generated directly from the database schema, significantly reducing backend development time and costs.
- **Automatic Updates/Immediacy**:
    - Changes to the database schema are immediately reflected in the API, eliminating the need for manual synchronization or maintenance.
- **Performance**:
    - With a lightweight and stateless design, it executes SQL queries directly, achieving very fast data access.
- **Flexibility**:
    - In addition to simple CRUD operations, complex operations such as query combinations, filtering, and sorting can be easily performed.
- **Security**:
    - Provides a high level of protection against attacks like SQL injection through strict type checking and automatic query parameter escaping.

## **RESTful Architecture**

This API adopts standard HTTP methods and offers intuitive and user-friendly CRUD operations based on RESTful architecture. This design allows for broad integration with various programming languages and applications, enabling developers to easily integrate systems.

Additionally, the following advanced features are provided:

- **Filtering and Searching**:
    - Use complex query parameters to precisely extract only records that match specific conditions.
- **Sorting and Pagination**:
    - Sort result sets and use pagination to deliver data in small chunks.
- **Relational Queries**:
    - Retrieve data from multiple related tables with a single query, allowing for data retrieval that leverages relational database relationships without requiring multiple API calls.
- **Aggregation**:
    - Include aggregation functions such as grouping, counting, averaging, maximum, and minimum in queries.
- **Batch Requests**:
    - Execute multiple API calls with a single HTTP request, reducing network latency and achieving efficient data processing.

In addition to these, various features are provided by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). Please refer to the reference materials below for more details.

## Quick Start

This section explains step-by-step how to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Morph's API.

In this example, we use cURL commands to call the API, so please paste the commands into your terminal environment or an API client tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to try them out.

### API Call

*Please replace **`[Your_DatabaseID]`, `[Your_Table_Slug]`, `[Your_API_Key]`** with your actual values.*

**Create**:

To create new data, use the POST method.
```sh
curl --location --request POST 'https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/[Your_Table_Slug]' \
--header 'x-api-key: [Your_API_Key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "column1": "value1",
    "column2": "value2"
}'
```

**Read**:

To read data from a table, use the GET method.

```sh
curl --location 'https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/[Your_Table_Slug]' \
--header 'x-api-key: [Your_API_Key]'

```
**Update**:

To update existing data, use the PUT method.

```sh
curl --location --request PUT 'https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/[Your_Table_Slug]' \
--header 'x-api-key: [Your_API_Key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "column1": "new_value1"
}'
```

**Delete**:

To delete data, use the DELETE method.

```sh
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/[Your_Table_Slug]' \
--header 'x-api-key: [Your_API_Key]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "column1": "value_to_delete"
}'

```

In addition to these, you can achieve various query patterns according to your needs using [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). Please refer to the reference materials below for more details.

## API URL

The API URL has the following format.

BaseURL: `https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/`

**How to check the Database ID (`[Your_DatabaseID]`)**

In the Morph workspace, the Database ID is displayed after `/workspace`.

`https://beta-app.morphdb.io/workspace/[database_id]?selected...`

**How to check the Table Name (`[Your_Table_Name]`)**

When querying a specific table in the database schema, the API URL has the following format.

URL: `https://beta-api.morphdb.io/v0/rest/[Your_DatabaseID]/[Your_Table_Name]`

The table name is displayed in the Built-in Tables section of the sidebar. It is also displayed in the editor tab when selecting a table.
