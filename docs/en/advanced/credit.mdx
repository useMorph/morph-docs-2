Morph manages the execution of cloud machines for running workspaces and AI functions through credit consumption.

Each plan includes a certain number of credits, which can be purchased additionally.

<Warning>The validity period of credits purchased is 1 month.</Warning>

## Credit consumption

Each function consumes credits according to the following table.

### VM execution

Morph's workspaces run on Virtual Machines (VMs). When a VM is running, credits are consumed.

| Instance type | CPU | Memory | Credit consumption / hour |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Standard | 2vCPU | 4GB | 100 |
| Large | 4vCPU | 8GB | 200 |
| XLarge | 8vCPU | 16GB | 400 |

### Storage

Credit consumption is applied based on the size of the built-in PostgreSQL and the VM disk capacity at the end of the month.

| Service | Credit consumption / GiB |
| :--- | :--- |
| Built-in PostgreSQL | 300 |
| VM capacity | 300 |

<Warning>
The built-in PostgreSQL capacity is limited to 0.5GiB for the free plan.

For the Pro plan, the credit consumption is not applied up to 5GiB.
</Warning>

### AI functions

| AI function | Credit consumption |
