The Coding Assistant uses Morph's AI to support you writing code.

When you open a file in the editor, you can access Morph AI from the tab on the right side of the screen. Currently, the officially supported file extensions are listed below. If you open any of these files in the editor, Morph AI will automatically function as a coding assistant.

- Python (.py)
- SQL (.sql)
- MDX (.mdx)
- TypeScript JSX (.tsx)
- VEGA-LITE (.vg.json)

The Coding Assistant understands the content of the current file and the structure of the data sources it references, enabling it to assist with code modification and refactoring.
