title: 'Built-in PostgreSQL'
---
Morph has a built-in PostgreSQL database. This database can be utilised to temporarily store intermediate results of the data pipeline or to store final results and connect to external services.

Open the workspace and go to the Data tab. From this tab you can use the Built-in PostgreSQL.

From the Morph workspace, you can perform basic table and record editing.

## Connect Externally

The connection string listed under ‘Postgres Connection’ on the screen is the connection string to access PostgreSQL hosted on the workspace. This can also be used to connect from external database clients or applications.

## IP Restrictions

It is very important to set up security when connecting to PostgreSQL externally.
You can restrict the IPs with access in the ‘IP Restrictions’ section of the Morph workspace.

<Warning>The default setting is ‘0.0.0.0/0’, so be sure to set IP restrictions before inserting important data as access is possible from anywhere.</Warning>
