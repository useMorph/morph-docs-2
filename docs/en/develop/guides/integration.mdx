## Connecting to SaaS

<Warning>SaaS connections are only available in the cloud version.</Warning>

Morph provides integration with some SaaS services.
By using these integrations, you can delegate all authentication implementations to Morph and focus on implementing business logic.

Here is how to obtain an access_token from an Integration created in Python.

```python
import pandas as pd

import morph
from morph import MorphGlobalContext
from morph_lib.api import get_auth_token

@morph.func
def get_salesforce_opportunities(context: MorphGlobalContext) -> pd.DataFrame:
    access_token = get_auth_token("salesforce-connection-name")

    # ↓↓↓ call API with access_token ↓↓↓
```
