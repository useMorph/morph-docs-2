Morph is a python-centric full-stack framework for building and deploying data apps.

As the importance of data utilization continues to grow, many companies are seeking efficient and rapid data analysis. However, traditional BI tools and data application construction methods do not sufficiently address technical and operational challenges.

Morph is designed to fundamentally rethink these challenges and enable more flexible and team-centric data utilization.

## Challenges of Traditional BI Tools

BI tools have democratized data utilization by providing non-engineering users with access to and visualization of data. However, their design philosophy has limitations.

1. Lack of Agility

BI tools are fundamentally based on static dashboards and predefined flows, making it difficult to quickly iterate and experiment in response to rapidly changing business needs.

2. Insufficient Collaboration with Engineers

BI tools that emphasize no-code make it difficult for engineers to participate in the data analysis cycle, making it challenging to leverage their expertise to solve complex data issues.

3. Limitations in Scalability and Flexibility

When trying to build advanced data applications beyond basic reporting, BI tools hit their limits and fail to meet business requirements.

## Current State and Challenges of Data Application Development

Frameworks for building data applications for engineers are powerful in that they allow for the creation of advanced applications in a local environment. However, there are still challenges when it comes to actual business use.
- Complexity of Deployment

To share applications internally and externally, it is necessary to set up hosting environments and authentication settings, which requires a lot of resources and time.

- Difficulty in Team Utilization

Because they are specialized for developers, there is a lack of mechanisms for non-engineering users to use and provide feedback on applications in real-time.

## What Morph Solves

Morph is a framework that addresses these challenges and provides data applications that can be quickly built, shared, and utilized. By using Morph, you can break down the barriers surrounding data and achieve truly agile data utilization.

### Features of Morph

1. Fast Construction and Flexibility

Morph provides an environment where advanced data analysis and application construction can be quickly performed by combining Python, SQL, and MDX (extended Markdown). It is not constrained by the limitations of dashboards and can immediately respond to changing requirements.

2. Easy Deployment and Secure Sharing

Data applications created locally can be deployed to the cloud with a single `morph sync` command. User authentication and access restrictions are automatically set, allowing anyone to share applications securely.

3. Team-Centric Collaboration

Morph breaks down the barriers between engineers and business users, allowing data applications to be shared in real-time. The entire team can iterate on feedback and accelerate decision-making from data.

4. Building Reusable Logic

By reusing the analysis logic and applications created in other projects, you can maximize operational efficiency and scale data utilization across the organization.

## Data Utilization Environment in the AI Era

In today's data utilization environment, the presence of AI cannot be ignored. Morph is designed with the premise of leveraging AI, as it was born in the AI era.

- Accelerating Construction with AI

Morph's loosely coupled architecture centered around Python allows for maximum utilization of AI's code generation capabilities. By combining MorphAI's construction support with AI code assistance tools like Cursor/Github Copilot, data application construction can be achieved at unprecedented speeds.

- Building Data Applications with Embedded AI

The demand for data applications that leverage AI is also growing explosively. The Python ecosystem has the world's largest ecosystem for leveraging the latest AI models. By embedding these into data applications with Morph and deploying them to teams, you can leverage the latest AI technologies.

## Why Morph is Needed Now

To maintain competitiveness, companies must have the ability to utilize data quickly and accurately. Morph was born to solve challenges that traditional tools and frameworks could not address.

Morph shortens the cycle from data analysis to decision-making and strengthens collaboration between the field and technical departments. It is not just a tool but a new framework to shape a data-driven future.

Morph pioneers the future of agile data utilization.
