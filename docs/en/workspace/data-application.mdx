Morph makes it easy to create rich data applications using a combination of markdown formats and React components.

This section provides step-by-step instructions for building data applications.

## MDX

When building data applications in Morph, use [MDX (https://mdxjs.com/)](https://mdxjs.com/) For more information on how to use MDX, see [Official MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/). See also.

## 0. Setup

{/* <Warning>通常この手順は、ワークスペースのシステムが自動で実行するため、スキップして構いません。どうしても起動がうまくいかない場合に試してください。</Warning> */}

To build a data application, first open the Morph workspace and execute the following commands. This may take several minutes.

```bash Shell
npm i -S @use-morph/page-build && npx morph-page init
```


## 1. Create MDX files

<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="/assets/images/docs/mdx-1.mp4"
></video>

First, create an mdx file to describe the content of your data application. mdx files combine text written in markdown format with React components to create rich content.
Create the mdx file in the `src` directory of your workspace home directory.

## 2. Edit MDX files

Once the MDX file has been created, the contents can be edited.

One very important element is the need to EXPORT two variables:

- `name`: This is the pathname of the page for this file. For example, if name is `index`, this is `/`, and if name is `about`, this is `/about`.

- `title`: This is the title of the page for this file. It appears in the menu and title in the screen.

The following is an example of an `index.mdx` file:

```tsx index.mdx

export const name = 'index';
export const title = 'Top page';

# Top page

This is the top page of the data application.

```

Normal markdown notation can be used.

## 3. Using Morph data

To use Morph data, a dedicated component is used to pass the name of the Python function or SQL file as a property.

Below is an example of a table display of a DataFrame from a Python run:

```tsx index.mdx

export const name = 'index';
export const title = 'Top page';

# Top page

This is the top page of the data application.

<div className="h-[600px] w-full">
  <DataTable alias="aggregate_py" />
</div>

```

For detailed specifications of Morph components, see the [Data Application page](/data-application/en/how-to-build-data-application).

## 4. Launching data applications

To start the data application, click on the Preview button in the top right-hand corner of the mdx file editing screen.

## 5. Accessing the entire data application in the Pages section

In the Pages section, you can access the data applications created within the workspace.
There is a button in the top right corner of the data application to switch between the created data applications.

You can easily share the data applications you have created with your team here.

<div className="h-[600px] w-full">
  <img src="/assets/images/docs/pages-section.png" alt="Pages section" />
</div>
