The Morph workspace consists of three sections:

- **Code:** a VS Code-based editor and a proprietary framework allow you to build data applications and analyse data fast.
- **Data:** Built-in PostgreSQL can be used. You can also create and manage RDB / data warehouse / SaaS connections.
- **Pages:** access the data applications you have built.
- **Jobs:** set up and check the execution logs of scheduled jobs.
