Within the Morph framework, you can freely utilize Python packages published on pip.

## Installation / Deployment

Morph allows you to use data applications by automatically starting VMs in both the Editor and Viewer modes.
This VM reads the `requirements.txt` file in the project root and automatically installs the packages.

You must always provide a `requirements.txt` file when deploying.

        Open the terminal from the "Code" tab in the Editor mode and run the pip command.

        ```bash Shell
        pip install {パッケージ名}
        ```

        If the installation is successful, a `requirements.txt` file will be automatically created in the project, and it will be installed automatically at startup.

        You can use the pip packages installed in your Python environment.

        When deploying, make sure to output the packages you are using in the `requirements.txt` file.
        ```bash Shell
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```
