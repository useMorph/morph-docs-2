title: 'Code Generation'
---
Morph AI's code generation feature generates initial code from plain-text prompts when creating SQL and Python files. This feature is only available from the Canvas.

The information that can be specified during generation for each language is as follows:

## SQL

- Table: Generates SQL tailored to the database of the specified table.
- SQL or Python Result (only the result is a DataFrame): Generates SQL using DuckDB by specifying the aggregation results in the FROM clause or JOIN clause.

<Warning>
You can use multiple tables or multiple aggregation results, but you cannot specify both tables and aggregation results at the same time.
</Warning>

## Python

- Integration: Generates Python code using the API or SDK of the SaaS associated with the specified Integration.
- SQL or Python Result: Loads the aggregation results with @morph.load_data() to generate Python code.
