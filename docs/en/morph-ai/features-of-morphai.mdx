Morph AI provides advanced capabilities focused on data analysis to power users' data-driven decision-making. This section details the features and benefits of Morph AI.

## Why Morph AI is special

While analysis is possible in regular AI chat, Morph AI is specifically designed for data analysis and provides more accurate results for your requirements. It differs from regular AI chat in the following ways

- **Understands the data schema:** because Morph AI understands the schema (structure) of the user's database, it can understand the relationships between tables and the meaning of columns, enabling accurate analysis that takes into account data relationships. This ensures that even complex queries get the right results quickly.
- **Can take into account the schema resulting from previous and subsequent data processing:** the schema generated at each step of data processing can be understood and passed on appropriately to the next step. This allows data processing to proceed efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the entire pipeline.
- **Able to give knowledge such as the meaning of each column:** users can provide the AI with knowledge about the meaning and use of columns, which allows the AI to perform more accurate queries and analyses. For example, it can analyze sales trends with the understanding that columns in sales data represent revenue.

## Build multi-step data pipelines

Morph AI has the ability to automatically build complex data pipelines based on user requirements. All the user has to do is tell Morph AI the desired analysis results, and Morph AI will design and execute all the necessary steps. For example, even in complex cases involving multiple SQL queries or Python scripts, Morph AI will smoothly build the pipeline. Furthermore, the code for each step can be manually modified as required, allowing fine-tuning while maintaining the integrity of the entire pipeline.

## Generate and modify code

Morph AI can automatically generate and modify SQL and Python code for each step. This allows users to perform advanced data analysis without any technical expertise. Furthermore, even when connected to an external database, Morph AI generates optimised code that takes into account the database schema. For example, if new tables are added or existing columns are modified, it automatically adapts and provides accurate queries.
