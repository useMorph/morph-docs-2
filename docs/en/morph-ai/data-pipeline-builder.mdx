title: 'Data Pipeline Builder'
---
When you open a Canvas (.canvas.json) file, you can use Morph AI to automatically build a multi-step data pipeline.

Specifically, it operates as follows:

1. The user provides instructions for the data pipeline they want to build.
2. Based on the instructions, Morph AI plans the SQL and Python files and their processes that should be included in the data pipeline.
3. Using this plan, it generates the actual codes of the files.
4. (Only if the user selects "Continue") The generated files are executed sequentially. If an error occurs during execution, Morph AI automatically fixes it based on the error message.

By delegating the task to Morph AI, users can obtain the data pipeline without having to build each file individually.
Since all the deliverables are built with SQL and Python, you can use the execution results as templates to further customize your data pipeline.
